This repository is focused on integrating the 
[Geant4 simulation framework](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/geant4) 
into another [event processing framework](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/fire).

This is centered upon a processor that does the necessary
configuring, processing, and persisting steps tied with Geant4.
